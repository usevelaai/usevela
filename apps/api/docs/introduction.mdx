## Overview

vela API provides a streaming chat interface powered by Claude with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) capabilities. The API automatically searches a vector database for relevant context and incorporates it into responses.

## Base URL

```
http://localhost:3001
```

## Features

- **Streaming responses** - Real-time SSE streaming following the ChatKit protocol
- **RAG integration** - Automatic vector search for context-aware responses
- **Claude-powered** - Uses Claude claude-sonnet-4-20250514 for high-quality responses

## Quick Start

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3001/chat \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "messages": [
      {"role": "user", "content": "Hello!"}
    ]
  }'
```

## Response Format

The API uses Server-Sent Events (SSE) following the ChatKit protocol:

1. `message_start` - Indicates start of assistant response
2. `content_block_start` - Indicates start of content block
3. `content_block_delta` - Contains text chunks
4. `content_block_stop` - Indicates end of content block
5. `message_stop` - Indicates end of message
